This is a web application created by me from scratch using HTML and CSS.
1.There are two main files in which the code exists.
-->index.html
-->styles.css

2.To run the website just open the index.html file using any web browser.

3.All the stying of the application are written in styles.css.

4.There are some images which are used in the website.All the imaages which are used are mentioned in the repo.

5.The web application consists of a responsive "contact me" form.It is created without using any backend like PHP or Javascript.

6.I created this responsive form using two different websites.
-->formsubmit.co : This is used to generate a random link of the form which should be placed in the form.
-->formspree.com : This is used to create the form and link your email address to this form.So that when some one fills the form  we can
get a mail to our inbox directly without any backend.
